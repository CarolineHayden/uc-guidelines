### Acquisition Information
The Bruce Conner papers were given to The Bancroft Library by Bruce Conner and, subsequently, The Conner Family Trust beginning in 1996 with additions continuing through 2010. **The digital files were received on seven compact discs in 2008. Disk images of the compact disks were created on November 21, 2013 to generate master preservation copies and to extract the content files.**
 
### Appraisal Information
**Temporary digital files (.tmp file format) and system files were removed from this collection, according to the Library’s digital preservation and privacy policies.**  
 
### Accruals
Future additions are expected.
 
### System of Arrangement
Papers are arranged to the folder level. See the specific arrangement notes for each series. **Digital files are organized in their original file structure. Please see the attached file directory list for a complete inventory of all available files.**
 
### Processing Information
Papers processed by Dean Smith in 2009-2010. **Digital materials processed by Nissa Nack in 2015 under the supervision of Kate Tasker.**  

**The digital files in this collection were received on seven compact discs. The majority of the files were created by Bruce Conner as digital images of pages in his personal scrapbooks. Text files in .doc format and audio recordings in .mp3 format are also present. The digital files were originally saved to the compact discs using an Apple (Mac) computer with an HFS+ file system, type and age unknown.**
 
**Disk images of the seven compact discs were created by Library staff on November 21, 2013 using Forensic Toolkit (FTK) Imager, with the resulting seven .iso disk image files saved to preservation storage. MD5 checksums were assigned to the disk images at the point of creation. The compact discs were scanned for viruses before imaging, with no results.**
 
**The disk images were processed in July 2015. 936 files were extracted and analyzed in FTK version 5.0. Temporary files and system files were identified and removed, leaving 595 content files in .doc, .psd, .pct, .jpg, .tif, and .mp3 formats. All files were screened for personally identifiable information (PII), and no files were restricted. The processed files were exported from FTK in their original formats and in their original file structure and were saved to the Library's preservation server.**
 
**Copies of the original image files (.psd, .pct, .jpg, and .tif formats) were normalized to TIFF files for preservation and to JPG files for research access, using Adobe Bridge CS6 version 5.0.2.4 x64. Copies of the original text files (.doc format) were normalized to PDF files for preservation and for research access using Adobe Acrobat XI Pro version 11.0.17. Copies of the original audio files (.mp3 format) were normalized to WAV files for preservation and to MP3 files for research access using Audacity version 2.1.1.**
 
**Some filenames were truncated during processing due to different filename character limits in Mac and Windows file systems. A full list of the truncated and original filenames is available upon request.**
 
### Biographical Information
“Bruce Conner in twenty-five words or less: Bruce Conner is the best cereal in America.
Tasty and nutritious. He never gets soggy. He's always crisp.”
- Richard Brautigan (1975)
 
Sculptor, filmmaker, collagist, painter, draftsman, photographer, conceptual prankster, Bruce Conner defined the very qualities of artistic freedom and in doing so boldly defied categorization and mainstream co-option in pursuit of his visionary images and ideas.
 
Born in McPherson, Kansas, in 1933, Bruce Conner spent his childhood and young adulthood in nearby Wichita. Upon graduating from Wichita High School East, Conner went on to study art at Wichita University and University of Nebraska, where he met his wife-to-be, Jean Sandstedt. He continued art studies at the Brooklyn Art School and the University of Colorado. In 1957, at the urging of his childhood friend, the poet Michael McClure, and attracted by stories of a vibrant art and literary scene that included visual artists Jay DeFeo, Joan Brown, and Jess, and poets Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Philip Whalen, and Philip Lamantia, he and his wife, Jean, moved to San Francisco. Conner subsequently became a key figure in the City’s legendary Beat community. After brief sojourns to Mexico City, 1961-1962, where his son, Robert was born, and Brookline, Massachusetts, 1963-1964, Conner resettled in San Francisco where he continued to live and work until his death.

The scrapbooks are included in the collection. Born-digital files, including MP3 audio recordings, digital images, and text documents are also present. All of the digital files were created on a Mac computer using the HFS+ file system and burned to seven compact discs.**
