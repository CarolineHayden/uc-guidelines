# Attaching Files to the Online Archive of California

File lists, directory lists, and other supplementary files can be linked from the finding aid in such a way that they will display on the Online Archive of California (OAC). This can be a helpful way for institutions who use California Digital Library’s (CDL) services to share these documents with researchers in cases where they have been generated as part of the description process and the institution wishes to provide access to them. File lists are attached using the EAD <extref>**[24]** element, which links to a file hosted on another server. A document linked using the <extref> element can be hosted simply on another server, or by the OAC/CDL itself. In the case of documents hosted by OAC, pdf files attached using the instructions (linked below) will also be indexed for search.**[25]**

OAC’s guide to submitting supplemental pdf finding aids, directory, or files lists can be found here: https://help.oac.cdlib.org/support/solutions/articles/9000093762-submitting-supplemental-pdf-finding-aids

[24] <extref> is an obsolete element in EAD3 and is no longer part of the schema. The authors are awaiting guidance from OAC about which EAD3 element will be used as its replacement for this functionality going forward. At the time of this writing EAD2002 was still the standard in use by most of the contributing institutions. 

[25] Note that _only_ pdf files can be attached using the OAC-hosted method -- the architecture does not currently allow for any other file types.
