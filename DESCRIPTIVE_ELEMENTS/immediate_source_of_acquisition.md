### OPTIONAL
Record general information about the acquisition of born-digital material, such as the source, date, and type of acquisition, in an Immediate Source of Acquisition Note. However, since acquisition of born-digital content often involves technical processing and data capture after media has been physically transferred, the specific methods and processes of born-digital acquisition and data capture should be detailed in a Processing Information Note. Refer to the Processing Information section in this document. Do not enter specific technical details in Immediate Source of Acquisition.

#### EXAMPLE:
**"The digital files from the Reginald E. Zelnik papers were donated to the Library by Elaine Zelnik on January 21, 2011, on six 5.25 inch floppy disks. The floppy disks were disk imaged on March 16, 2015 to create master preservation copies and to extract the content files."**
