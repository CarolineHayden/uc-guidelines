# Container List and Inventory

### RECOMMENDED
Including a container list or inventory in a finding aid can provide an additional layer of insight into the digital materials within a given collection. A file list that includes filepaths may be especially useful in this regard, as allowing researchers to view filenames and directory structures remotely may help facilitate identification and location of the material in which they are interested. This has the potential to save both time and resources. 

This information can be generated in a number of ways depending on the format, age, condition, and variety of the digital material.

#### Manually:
Even a basic list or spreadsheet of the media formats, dates (if known), and contents of the media in a collection can provide a useful point of reference. If the donor provided extensive description of or information about the digital portion of a collection, consider making it available as a container list. 

#### Automatically:
File lists or inventories can be easily generated automatically during processing and/or appraisal using tools such as Directory List and Print Pro. Creating a file list does not take very much work to do, and can yield a surprising amount of information. However, these inventories can often be lengthy, so it is better to link out to a separate document that contains this information rather than including it directly in the finding aid. 
* Ex. **"For a complete inventory of files, please see: [link]"**

However, just because inventories may be easy to generate automatically does not mean that they should be relied upon for description. It is generally worthwhile to attach a file inventory to a finding aid or collection record, but _it should not serve as the only description_, especially without review and possibly editing for clarification. Filenames may be inaccurate, misleading, or too vague to be helpful. In addition, the inclusion of a large and complex file list can have implications for public service staff, who may have to spend more time explaining these lists to researchers than they would with a standard finding aid.

It is recommended that file lists always be generated as part of processing born-digital records, but not that it be solely relied upon for description and access.
