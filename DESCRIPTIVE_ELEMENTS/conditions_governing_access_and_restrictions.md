### REQUIRED [12]
Exactly as described in DACS, this element provides information about access restrictions on files due to the nature of the information in the materials being described. For the purpose of digital collections, use of this field does not change. If there are any restrictions or conditions governing access, this should be noted at every level to ensure that researchers are aware of them. 

#### EXAMPLES:
* >**"Open for research, with the following exceptions: Boxes 136 and 137 include hard drives that contain files of Smith’s digital journals, which are restricted until 25 years after Smith's death (September 15th, 2037). Box 352 of medical files are restricted until 50 years after Smith’s death (June 11, 2061). Certain digital files are restricted until June 2056."**

* >**"The UCSF Archives and Special Collections policy places access restrictions on material with privacy issues for a specific time period from the date of creation. Access to records that contain personal and confidential information about an individual or individuals is restricted for 75 years from date of creation or until the death of the individual mentioned in the records, whichever is longer.  Medical records are restricted for 50 years after an individual’s date of death, if known. If the date of death is unknown, access is restricted for 100 years from the individual’s date of birth or 100 years from the date of record creation, whichever occurs first.
<br/>  Some audio recordings have been restricted to protect personal identifiable information or Protected Health Information (PHI) in accordance with federal regulations and UCSF Archives and Special Collections privacy policies.
