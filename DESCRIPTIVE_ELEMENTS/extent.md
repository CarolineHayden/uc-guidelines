Additionally, record a quantitative measurement of processed digital content in an Extent statement. This measurement should be recorded separately from any Extent statement(s) for physical material. Use parallel Extent statements, if necessary. At minimum, record the extent of digital content in gigabytes (GB). Optionally, add an Extent statement to record the number of digital files.

HYBRID COLLECTION:
* _**Extent: 109 linear feet**_

[11] Though the Extent element (<extent>) has been completely deprecated in EAD3, for the purpose of this document the authors will continue to use the language “Extent” and give that name to the descriptive element outlined here. As descriptive standards change the authors may also change the terminology of this document, but for now the authors will continue to use the terminology that is most widely-shared among the community, which is “Extent.”
