# Scope and Content

* RDA: Summarization of Content, 7.10

### RECOMMMENDED
The Scope and Content note should address the 'who, what, where, when, why, and how' of digital materials. The level and kinds of detail included in the Scope and Content note will depend largely on the collection and the nature and extent of the materials being described. Therefore, it's possible that certain information in the Scope and Content note may be repeated elsewhere in the finding aid such as Processing Information, Extent, etc. Some repetition is fine, but the focus of this section is more about the creation of the records than technical access requirements. The level or levels at which scope and content notes are applied should be chosen according to existing guidelines laid out in DACS, which should be the guide for any other scope and content questions not covered in this document as well. 

Oftentimes, a processor will be updating or editing an existing Scope and Content note written by the original processing archivist. In cases like this, try to balance the tone and description of the born-digital content with the existing description provided for the analog material, to maintain a co-authorship with the original processor.

According to DACS 3.1, the Scope and Content note briefly details how the materials were created. For digital materials, this might include the type of computer, software, other significant media, operating systems, version numbers, etc., and how many years of the donor or content creator’s digital life are included amongst the data. In this vein, an important consideration is the method used to determine when digital material was created. Please see "Date range of the materials" bullet point below for specific guidance on this subject. 

For larger, more complex collections, breaking down numbers of files by format might be helpful.
* Ex: **"3,498 documents (.pdf), 4,312 images (.jpg), and 29 spreadsheets (.xlsx)."**

Consider briefly describing any highly proprietary software or hardware or unusual creation techniques. (E.g. art made on fax machines; digital video art that includes errors and glitches inherent to the work). In general, when noting specific hardware or software, be as clear as possible about what the software/hardware is -- it might not exist in 5, 10, or 20 years, and even if it does, users might not have any point of reference for it (but use your judgement--what matters in the context of the collection and the creator?). Consider including its primary function, software provider/vendor, whether proprietary or open-source, software version, date if known.**[15]

### RECOMMENDED
### Description of functions, processes, or activities that led to creation of materials themselves
Keep in mind that you should focus on the materials themselves, not the context in which they were created. That information will be recorded in the Administrative/Biographical note. However, in the case of born-digital records, this could be a helpful section in which to describe the operating systems, hardware, software, and significant media used to create the materials being described. This differs from the Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements note in that it pertains to the creation of the records, not to the access requirements and limitations pertaining to the collection as it exists in the archives. 

### The documentary form(s) or types of records being described
This may include correspondence, minutes, reports, data sets, web pages, videos, photographs, etc. Be sure to consider adding file format types in a large, complex collection (.jpg, .pdf, .xlsx) and the number of files.

### Date range of the materials
Although DACS advises processors to use the date(s) of creation, this is not always straightforward for digital material.**[16]** Exercise caution when assigning dates to digital material, and include in the Scope and Content note how dates were determined and/or assigned: Date Created? Date Last Opened/Modified? This can be confusing when a donor has migrated materials from one computer or hard drive to another, or in cases where an error has altered the Date Created to erroneously read "December 31, 1969".**[17]**

Prefer the “last modified” date of the files if possible, as this is generally more reliable than the “created” date. Use the “created” date if “last modified” is not available.

### Authenticity and related content
Although the concept of authenticity has always played an important role in archives, given digital media’s inherent vulnerability and the ease with which files can change, be duplicated, or become corrupt, it is an especially crucial aspect of born-digital processing and preservation. Broadly defined, authenticity refers to digital material being, "what it purports to be."**[18]** Establishing authenticity for digital material can be a complex and multifaceted process. Although local policies and requirements will vary throughout the UC system, it is important to include information about the authenticity of digital material if this information has been gathered and recorded. This might include retaining technical details associated with the file’s creation, arrangement, or acquisition, and/or recording details associated with the file’s accompanying metadata such as the assignation of Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs), hash values or checksums. 
* Ex. "Smith's digital material relates to various writing projects she undertook between 1989-2006. These project files include research and notes, drafts, edits, and supplementary material. Smith routinely backed up her old computer files onto newer machines, which resulted in some file duplication across systems. Duplicates have been retained to maintain original order, but to avoid confusion, all files were assigned Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) and checksums during processing, and their 'Last Modified' dates have been preserved and retained."

### DO _NOT_ INCLUDE:
* Information about the context in which the material being described was created, used, "and so on" (put this in Administrative/Biographical History).
* Information about gaps in the material resulting from archival appraisal decisions (i.e. weeding; put this in Appraisal note).

#### EXAMPLES:
**Collection-level (hybrid collection):**
* >[Sample text from Duke University](http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/stricklandstephanie/#historicalnote): "The Stephanie Strickland Papers include printed journals and anthologies featuring Strickland's poetry, programs and posters from Strickland's publications and performances; school materials from high school to graduate school; articles and anthologies; electronic media (removed); videotapes; and other miscellaneous materials. There are source materials from works such as Zone : Zero, True North, Sand Soot, and Vniverse; conference programs; journals; and gallery catalogs and other sources used in her work, as well as files, proofs, and drafts from Strickland's V : Vniverse, True North, Zone : Zero, Red Virgin, Give the Body Back, V : WaveSon.nets / Losing L'una, Dragon Logic and other Strickland poems, essays, and compilations. There is a small amount of print correspondence and event material. There is a larger amount of electronic correspondence. Electronic media has been separated from the accession and housed on Duke's electronic records server but has been described in this collection guide.There are several VHS and cassette recordings of interviews with Stephanie Strickland and related to her work."

**Series-level (hybrid collection):**
* >"[Sample text from UC Irvine](http://pdf.oac.cdlib.org/pdf/uci/cta/c017.pdf): "This series comprises Richard Rorty's electronic word-processing files. Included are letters, many drafts of writings, lecture notes, syllabi, and exams. Also included are bibliographies of his work, a few administrative files, and a couple of documents relating to his children. This series also contains drafts of writings done by his peers and colleagues. Researchers will notice some data loss and corruption has occurred in some of the earliest files."

**Series-level (hybrid collection):**
* >"[Sample text from UC San Diego](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt709nb2cz): "Series 21) Born-digital material consists of computer drafts of Mac Low’s major works, including Forties and Steins, email files, poetry sourced from other authors, including Jim Cayley and Charles Doria, and custom computer programs written to generate poetry, mostly for MS-DOS. Files have been renamed to correctly reflect the format in which they were created. Formats mostly include Word documents (.doc), Outlook email files (.pst), and text documents (.txt). These were all created on Mac Low’s Power Macintosh 6100 and originally stored on 3.5 inch and 5.25 inch floppy disks."

**Sub-series level (hybrid collection):**
* >"The material contained in this sub-series consists of documents, graphics, spreadsheets, databases, software programs, video, audio, and other material created and/or stored on computers, storage media, and hard drives managed by Berenstain and their assistants. The digital files are forensically captured images of those stored on hard drives, 3.5 inch floppy disks, compact disks, zip disks, and other media in the Berenstain papers."

**Sub-series level:**
* >"The material contained in this subseries consists of documents, graphics, spreadsheets, databases, software programs, video, audio, and other material created and/or stored on computers, storage media, and hard drives managed by [creator]."

[15] At the time of writing, the IMLS-funded Software Preservation Network (http://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org), the 2008 JISC-funded study 'The Significant Properties of Software' (https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20100624233431/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/preservation/spsoftware_report_redacted.pdf) , and the Yale University Library CLIR/IMLS-funded project to explore Wikidata as a digital preservation knowledge base (http://openpreservation.org/blog/2016/09/30/wikidata-as-a-digital-preservation-knowledgebase/) were helpful resources.  

[16] DACS chapter 2.4 instructs processors to describe a date or date range using the date(s) of creation, but does not yet address dates of born-digital material. The "creation" date recorded by file systems can be easily and inadvertently changed simply by copying a file from one location to another. The "last modified" date persists when files are copied, and arguably could be considered the more precise date, as it indicates when the last changes were made.

[17] This date commonly appears because it refers to the Unix operating system's epoch date. See http://mentalfloss.com/article/26316/why-does-my-gadget-say-its-december-31-1969.
