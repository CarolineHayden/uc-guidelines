# Absract

* DACS: Scope and Content Element, 3.1
* EAD3: Abstract <abstract>
* ArchivesSpace: Abstract Note
* MARC: 520
* ISAD(G): N/A
* RDA: Summarization of Content, 7.10


### RECOMMENDED
If there is significant born-digital material present in a collection, the Abstract should reflect this. Try to differentiate the descriptive language in the Abstract from the Scope and Content note to avoid redundancy if you will be using both elements separately. For instance, if you have listed the formats present in a given collection in the Scope and Content note, there is no need to repeat that information in the Abstract. 

#### EXAMPLES:
* _“[...]The collection includes the following: personal and professional correspondence including email; journals; documents relating to her political activism; **and digital audiovisual recordings related to her work at the Humane Society.**”_

* _“Jane Smith is an engineer, scientist, and professor based in Los Angeles. The collection consists of sketches, correspondence, published and unpublished teaching materials, **email correspondence, and born-digital datasets related to her research on radio frequencies.**”_
