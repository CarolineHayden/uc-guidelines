### REQUIRED
The Processing Information section is one of the most important aspects of any finding aid that describes born-digital materials. Decisions made during processing can greatly affect who, what, where, when, why and how researchers access and understand the digital material within a given collection. In particular, processing legacy born-digital material can often involve changing the nature of the data to make it preservable and accessible: this may include migrating to different file formats, redacting or removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII), extracting files, or normalizing filenames. It is essential that this information be recorded to ensure that future archivists and users understand where the materials came from, how they were created, and the process by which they are able to access the materials.**[20]**

For the cases in which libraries are not able to make born-digital materials accessible, even after preserving content, this section will also allow users to understand access limitations of old file formats or hardware. It is essential that organizations include information in their finding aids about some of the key preservation actions and techniques employed during processing. 

As is clear from the lengthy list of bullet points that follow, this can sometimes mean that the Processing Information section can become top-heavy, and often with information that is not collection-specific. For example, acquisition procedures, PII scans, virus scans, and file normalization methods may be standard processing steps for any collection with born-digital materials. Therefore, the authors recommend using the section to link to a Processing Information document that lives _outside of the finding aid_, potentially with other standard processing procedures. Please see the Systems of Record section of this guide for more information about why this option can be useful.

### REQUIRED
### Removal or redactions
Briefly note if any files were redacted or removed during processing as a result of PII screening or because of donor requests. Try to keep this to one sentence or part of one sentence, and avoid going into specifics. (Detailed information about restrictions should be recorded in the Conditions Governing Access and Restrictions section).

If any material is removed or redacted either as a result of the PII screening--such as contact information, medical/student records, or bank account numbers--or in accordance with departmental or institutional policies, consider indicating the reasoning or policies in place that guided this decision.
* Ex. **"Some files have been redacted to protect personal identifiable information or Protected Health Information (PHI) in accordance with federal regulations and UCSF Archives and Special Collections privacy policies."**
Briefly explaining what happens to the restricted or redacted content. 
* Ex. **"Content was removed from access copy and quarantined with master copy for preservation."**

Use the Restriction note to document these actions in greater detail.

### Unprocessed material
Some collections may contain some digital material that has not been or cannot be processed. In cases like this, it is important to provide researchers with a clear understanding of what item(s) remain unprocessed. 
Note the number and format of any unprocessed items. If processing was attempted but ultimately not possible, note the reason(s) why this material could not be processed. (E.g. institutional policy, lack of identifying labels or description, an item’s UC Value Score, a lack of appropriate technology, a technological error such as an unrecognized file system, physical degradation that prevents an item from being read, or a combination thereof.)

In cases where a repository has the ability to process material but has not yet processed it, indicate that the materials are not available in their original format and must be reformatted to a digital access copy.

### Reformatting or normalization
Note whether files have been reformatted and/or normalized for preservation or access. In additiona, note tool, process or application used to transcode files, as well as the types changed.
* Ex. **".TIFF, .JPEG, .PICT, and .PSD files were normalized to the .TIFF format for preservation and the .JPEG format for access using Archivematica v 1.5.1."**

If your organization has a policy governing reformatting or normalization, consider mentioning or linking to it. 
* Ex. **"Files were normalized to preservation-standard formats according to the Library’s File Format Policy. For more information, see [permalink]."**

### Any other choices made during processing that may affect a researcher’s understanding of the digital material in question
No two collections are the same. There are a number of factors that may influence processing decisions including, but not limited to, institutional policy, available resources, format of the source media, available contextual information, technological constraints, etc. In certain instances, processors may make choices in order to facilitate access or preservation that, without context or explanation, could impact a researcher’s understanding of the files in a given collection. 

Examples of this could include: 
Modifying or cleaning the filenames in any way. 
* Ex. **"Many of the filenames in this collection were extremely similar [e.g. "Screenplay_Final.docx, Screenplay_Final(1).docx]. To avoid confusion, all original filenames in this collection have been appended with '_[Last Date Modified]' to help researchers distinguish between drafts."**

Altering (or choosing not to alter) the original file structure. 
* Ex. **"Files have been stored alphabetically by filename in a single directory."**
* Ex. **"The materials have not been arranged beyond file type."**

Deleting (or choosing not to delete) empty directories, folders, and/or duplicates.
* Ex. **"Sontag migrated files from one computer to the next; accordingly, duplication and variation in files are common. Files and folders with the same or similar titles may not have exactly the same contents; it is also not uncommon for segments of text to be repeated across files of different names, as many of the file instances are drafts and often build upon one another."**

Changing (or choosing not to change) permissions on files or folders.
* Ex. **"Content on the "LCROSS" DVD was locked, so a disk image could not be created."**

Reformatting or normalizing file formats for preservation and/or access.

Any instances where processors have chosen to pursue unique processing methods or procedures that diverge from typical processing policies or protocols.(E.g. the decision to retain both an original set of proprietary file formats as well as normalized versions of those files in anticipation of future emulation-based access strategies.)

### RECOMMENDED
### Mode of acquisition and/or file capture[21]
Understanding the process(es), hardware and software used to acquire media and/or capture files is important. Not only does this information help contextualize an acquisition, it can also help demonstrate chain of custody, authenticity, and provenance. It is especially important to document this information for files that were originally received on storage media (e.g. optical disks, floppy disks, flash drives, etc.), since the characteristics of these storage media can impact readability and integrity of the files in distinct ways. Include any information that may help a researcher better understand how the files arrived at an archive and what they were like prior to processing. 

This could include: 
* Whether the files were received as a single group or in multiple installments.
* The number and format(s) of storage media on which the files were received.
* The technique, hardware and software used to transfer files from the storage media on which the files were received. Indicate whether disk images were created or whether files were transferred using another tool or strategy such as applications that employ FTP, an email client, or via a third party cloud storage service like Google Drive or Box. Consider noting to where the files were transferred and/or where they’re being stored (e.g. a digital repository).  

### Virus scan
Indicate if a virus scan was performed. Performing a virus scan during processing is a standard practice, so if no virus scan was performed be sure to note this. You may also include any of the following:
* Whether any viruses or malware were found.
* Whether any suspicious files were deleted or removed.

### Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Note if the files have been screened for PII and indicate the software used to do this.

### File weeding and/or deletion
It is important to note whether or not any files were weeded or deleted during processing. This information is especially useful in cases where the size of processed files differs from the file size of the original acquisition. Include the reason(s) for weeding or deleting files: Were they duplicates? Did they lack research value? Was the library unable to provide access due to lack of required hardware, software, or system specifications? Were they inessential, system files, or proprietary program files? Were they deleted due to copyright concerns?

If duplicate files exist that have NOT been weeded or deleted, please note this information as well. 
* Ex. **"The original file structure has been maintained; duplicate files have not been deleted."**

### Checksums **[22]**
Checksums
Consider noting the files and/or disk images for which checksums were created. Generating checksums during processing is a standard practice, so if no checksums were created be sure to note this. 

If they were created, include what checksum format was used, (e.g. MD5, SHA-256, etc.) and note what tool was used to create the checksums, the level at which checksums were created, and when the checksumming took place.
* Ex. **"MD5 checksums were assigned to the disk images at the point of creation using FTK Imager, after which files were extracted from the disk images and assigned SHA-256 checksums using Archivematica version 1.5.1."**

### Filename cleaning and/or normalization
Often during processing filenames with special characters or undesirable formatting must be normalized to prevent technical glitches from occurring. If any of the original filenames were cleaned, changed, or amended during processing, it is important to provide a record of this. This will often occur when processing files from older media because modern file systems don’t allow certain characters (/,&,etc.) in filenames.

If filenames were changed at all during processing, mention why the names were changed. (E.g.  institutional practice, to facilitate access and discovery, forced or automated change by file system, etc.)

Assuming a record of the original filenames has been maintained, be sure to note that researchers may see the original filenames upon request.

### Hardware and software used
Providing information about the hardware and software used to perform various aspects of processing digital media may be helpful to researchers. This may be particularly useful in the context of larger, more complex donations, as these can include a wide array of digital media that required several different tools/workflows to process.

Note tool name and version, as well as its purpose. (E.g.  disk image creation, metadata reports, import/export, filename changes, etc.) 
Consider including the reason(s) a particular tool was chosen over another, if relevant. This could exist as boilerplate text that explains each of the common tools used institutionally for processing, with more specific information added in the core processing note. 
* Ex. **"FTK Imager was used to create exact, bit-level disk images of born digital media, and to generate checksums both before and after image capture to ensure fixity."**

### Institutional processing policies or guidelines
Include a link to your institution’s processing policies and guidelines, provided that they exist in a stable location and are kept up-to-date. This could exist as boilerplate text that is appended to the end of every Processing Information section. 
* Ex. **"This collection was processed in accordance with UC XX’s processing guidelines/policies. For more information, see [permalink]."**

#### EXAMPLES:
Example #1:
* >**"Fisher’s born digital files were received on 25 3.5 inch floppy disks, 19 5.15 inch floppy disks, a Windows-formatted 500 GB hard drive, and one .pst email file. The .pst file was transferred to UCSD using the secure RDL Share tool. Disk images from the floppy disks and hard drive were created using a Windows instance of FTK Imager, and were scanned for PII using Identity Finder. Files with personal information (social security numbers, bank account numbers) were removed from the access copies of the disk images and quarantined on a secure non-networked server for storage. No other content was restricted or redacted from the born digital files. A virus scan using Clam AV was performed on both the master disk images and the content processed for access. 4 3.5 inch floppy disks were removed from the original donation due to containing proprietary software not created by Fisher. Mp3 files found on the hard drive were reformatted to .WAV for preservation, using Archivematica’s normalization tool. The .pst file is currently awaiting processing for the completion of ePADD testing at UCSD."**

Example #2:
* >**"The AIDS Treatment News records were received from John Jacobs on two external hard drives. The files were extensively screened by the donor prior to transfer to the archives, mainly for mailing list and other contact information. Archives staff screened the material for viruses using Malware Bites, and for personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), and other protected information using Forensics Toolkit (FTK) version 5.5. Several files containing pieces of the publication mailing list have been removed. Email was ingested and processed using ePADD version 3.0, and named entities were noted and added as subject headings.   Some additional files were ingested on 20 compact disks, but were unable to be processed along with the rest of the collection due to an unidentifiable file system. The discs have been retained for further investigation."**

Exmaple #3:
* >**"Digital files from the Bruce Conner papers were acquired on seven compact disks, which were disk imaged to the .ISO format on 2013-11-21. The compact disks were scanned for viruses before imaging, with no results. Files were originally created on an Apple (Mac) computer using the HFS+ file system. The original file structure has been maintained. All files were screened for personally identifiable information (PII), and no files were restricted.** 
>
* >**Some filenames were modified during processing to enable files to be exported from the disk images. A list of modified filenames and their original filenames is available. Files were normalized to preservation-standard formats according to the Library’s File Format Policy, using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Bridge, and Audacity. .TIFF, .JPEG, .PICT, and .PSD files were normalized to the .TIFF format for preservation and the .JPEG format for access. Word documents were saved in the .PDF format for preservation and access, and .MP3 recordings were saved to .WAV format for preservation and a second .MP3 copy created for access."**

Exmaple #4:
* >**"UCLA received Sarah Smith’s files in two simultaneous installments. The first installment was a set of files that included drafts of Smith’s most recent writing projects, totalling 235 GB, which were received directly from Smith via FTP. After being scanned for viruses and malware in Forensic Toolkit (FTK) version 5.5, the cleaned files were arranged into two series: Screenplays (series #1), and Short Stories (series #2). Files within each of these series have been organized according to project title, but have not been further arranged. Duplicate files detected using hash values were deleted. Special characters were removed from file names to facilitate researcher access (for instance, files associated with Smith’s 2012 Western, “Never Apologize!”, have been changed to “Never Apologize”). The majority of the files in these series consisted of drafts written in Microsoft Word and the screenplay software Final Draft. These files were converted to PDFs using Archivematica version 1.5.1.**
>
* >**The second installment consisted of 3 external hard drives (each 500 GB), 27 DVDs (each 4.7 GB), and 11 Zip disks (each 250 GB) that contained files related to Smith’s charitable work including the non-profit she co-founded, Kids Write Now. Disk images were created of the DVDs using Guymager version 0.8.4; of these disk images, 2 disk images are unable to mount, which is likely due to file corruption inherent to the original media. In addition, 3 of the DVD-ROMs included files that were formatted as “read only”, which prevented us from creating disk images. Disk images of the external hard drives were created using Forensic Toolkit (FTK) version 5.5. Files were extracted from the disk images and were scanned for viruses using either Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) or Forensic Toolkit (FTK) version 5.5. The files received in this installment constitute their own series, Kids Write Now (“series #3). The original order of these files has been maintained, and the files have not been further arranged.**
>
* >**In all cases, files were ultimately processed and packaged for long-term preservation using Archivematica version 1.5.1. As per UCLA LSC’s processing guidelines, all files were scanned for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and some information or files have been redacted where appropriate. Files were normalized for preservation and access according to departmental policy. Please note: At the time of processing, UCLA LSC does not have a Zip drive and was therefore unable to image Zip disks.

___
[20] Note that information about the processor of the collection should be recorded as described in the “Processor” section of these guidelines, and not in the Processing Information element.

[21] General information about the acquisition of born-digital material, such as the source, date, and type of acquisition, may be appropriately recorded in an Immediate Source of Acquisitions Note (DACS: Immediate Source of Acquisition Element, 5.2; EAD 2002: Acquisition Information Element <acqinfo>; ArchivesSpace: Immediate Source of Acquisition Note; MARC: 541). However, since acquisition of born-digital content often involves technical processing and data capture after media has been physically transferred, the specific methods and processes of born-digital acquisition and data capture should be detailed in Processing Information. Do not enter specific technical details in Immediate Source of Acquisition.

[22] A checksum is a unique alphanumeric number that is used to help detect errors and ensure that a digital file remains unchanged over time.
