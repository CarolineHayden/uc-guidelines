### RECOMMENDED
Include a sentence or two about how the digital materials were organized and arranged: 

Note whether or not the original order of the files has been maintained.

Note whether the digital materials have been segregated into their own series or whether the digital material has been subdivided into multiple series, and if so on the basis of what (ie, content, format, etc.)? This is especially important to note in the context of hybrid collections, as well as in cases where there may be duplicative or overlapping material, which is often due to a donor’s migration and/or backup routines.

If the files have been arranged by the processor into a folder structure, be sure to include a description of any major necessary rearrangement--especially filename or structure changes, the creation of new "folders", etc. As a point of reference, use the following scenarios, as outlined by the Descriptive Standards Roundtable, of different degrees of intervention and arrangement.**[19]**

1. **No intervention by archivist:** The original order of the material has been retained without any intervention by the archives staff. This does mean that the collection may include filenames containing spelling mistakes and duplicate files that were placed in the wrong folder(s) by the creator.

1. **Minimal intervention by archivist:** The original order of the material has been retained without any intervention by the archives staff. With the material being received over time from the depositors some automatic processing has been undertaken to identify and remove files that are exactly the same as files already contained within the archive.

1. **Intervention by archivist:** The original order of the material as received by the archive service has not been retained as the arrangement of the material reflected the creator's current working practice. The material has been re-organised following consultation with the depositor into an order comprising a number of sections and sub-sections to allow subsequent digital material to be easily integrated into a single system of arrangement.

1. **Post-ingest intervention:** The material was ingested into our digital repository in its original order. As part of the processing work conducted by the archives staff some intellectual reorganisation of the material was undertaken to allow subsequent material to be easily integrated into a single system of arrangement. The arrangement presented here is a result of this intervention by archives staff, but the original file paths are recorded in the descriptions at lower levels. [The file path would then be added to the system of arrangement field at those lower levels]. 

Please note that there is potential for overlap between this field and the “Processing Information” field. Duplication may not be avoidable, but whereas “Processing Information” provides as complete a record as possible of the actions undertaken on the material, both before and after its arrival at the archive, “Arrangement” relates to recording decisions on arrangement only and to explaining what the arrangement (or perhaps more accurately the level of processing) is so that its impact on the material can be assessed.

#### EXAMPLES:
* >**"Born-digital materials are integrated into their corresponding series based on content. The original order of the files has been retained."**

* >**"Collection is arranged into series: Correspondence, which includes Strickland’s emails; Writings, including Strickland's projects, collaborations, essays, publications, and writings by others; Education and Academia; Miscellany; and Audiovisual."**

* >**"Ávila’s digital material has been arranged into two series: Photography, which includes various versions of image files she created for her 1994 exhibition, “Present Past”, and Writings, which includes drafts of artists statements, art criticism, and essays. In each series the files have been arranged into a single directory and are organized alphabetically by filename."**

* >**"The original structure, naming, and contents of the material have been maintained. Sontag migrated files from one computer to the next; accordingly, duplication and variation in files are common. Files and folders with the same or similar titles may not have exactly the same contents; it is also not uncommon for segments of text to be repeated across files of different names, as many of the file instances are drafts and often build upon one another."** 

* >**"Digital materials have been placed into the 'writings' series based on their content. No other changes have been made to the original arrangement, structure, or naming of the files."**
