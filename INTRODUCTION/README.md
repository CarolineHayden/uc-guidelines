# INTRODUCTION

To improve the clarity and usefulness of finding aids and to promote consistency across campuses, a working group of digital archivists under the aegis of the UC Born-Digital Common Knowledge Group (CKG) have collaborated to develop a UC-wide descriptive standard for born-digital archival material. The result of this work is a set of guidelines for creating and updating finding aids to include born-digital archival material. 

Currently there is no widely accepted descriptive standard that adequately addresses born-digital archival material. Although _Describing Archives: A Content Standard_ (DACS) is meant to apply to all material types, it is lacking in guidance addressing the various practices of digital processing and description as they have emerged at the participating UCs.**[1]** As a result, institutional practices for creating finding aids vary substantially throughout both the UC System and the field at large. The lack of clarity and agreement in this area has resulted in a proliferation of finding aids that fail to accurately express the quality, quantity, and usability of digital material. Not only does this diminish accessibility, it is also inefficient; each organization must ‘re-invent the wheel’ when it comes to describing born-digital archival content. 
<br />

## Background and Methodology
As of January 2017, four digital archivist positions had been created within the UC system at UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego, and UC San Francisco. Recognizing common workflows, challenges, and questions, these archivists began scheduling monthly phone calls to exchange ideas and brainstorm solutions. The challenge of integrating description for born-digital archival materials immediately stood out as a particularly complex issue at all campuses and became the focus of discussion.

In early 2017 the group decided to tackle this challenge with the goal of producing a shared set of guidelines on integrated description of UC born-digital archival material. The group scheduled weekly web conferences to identify elements of born-digital description; map these elements to existing standards, including DACS, EAD, and MARC; review related work such as the UC Guidelines for Efficient Archival Processing and the UK Archives & Records Association Descriptive Standards Roundtable’s [“Best Guess Guidelines for Cataloguing Born Digital Material”](http://www.archives.org.uk/images/Data_Standards/Best_Guess_Guidelines_v1.0_160325.pdf); examine and evaluate a wide variety of online finding aids at other institutions; consult local processing manuals and workflows; and discuss current approaches to born-digital description. 

Eight months of rigorous discussion and collaborative work produced these guidelines, which are based on existing descriptive standards, emerging best practices for born-digital materials, and archivists’ practical considerations.   
<br />

## Goals
The UC Guidelines for Born-Digital Archival Description will help the UCs:
* Evolve current descriptive and processing practices
* Raise awareness and deepen understanding of the unique challenges and requirements that born-digital material presents to archivists
* Suggest a set of baseline descriptive requirements for born-digital material  
* Align descriptive practices throughout the UC system
* Improve the overall quality and usability of finding aids
* Enhance intellectual control 
<br />

## How to Use These Guidelines
These guidelines were designed to be used as an extension of the [“Guidelines for Efficient Archival Processing in the University of California Libraries”](http://libraries.universityofcalifornia.edu/groups/files/hosc/docs/_Efficient_Archival_Processing_Guidelines_v3-1.pdf).**[2]** However, there is a key difference between these documents: while the latter provides recommendations to achieve a “golden minimum” by determining the appropriate processing level (from minimal to highly intensive), these guidelines do not attempt to define processing levels for born-digital materials.**[3]**  Instead, recognizing that there is currently no widely accepted method for applying descriptive standards to born-digital archival materials, the authors present comprehensive details for each descriptive element, to help establish norms and provide a thorough overview of the process. 

The highly-detailed guidelines are not intended to prompt or promote highly intensive processing for all collections. Each section establishes a required minimum baseline for archival description, as well as recommended and optional components of each descriptive element, with the expectation that users will tailor these guidelines to fit the needs of their given collections, paring them back or scaling them up where necessary. Components listed as “required” are intended to serve as a UC-wide baseline. Some will be listed as “required” even if there is no change in their use between physical and born-digital materials (meaning that this document does not add any new information to the instructions for using the descriptive element). Examples of multi-level description were composed with the intention that these can be customized to best meet the needs of any institution or collection, regardless of the level to which a given collection is processed. 

In the past, institutions both within and outside the UC system have taken an ad hoc approach to born-digital processing. While some of the included fields or instructions in these guidelines may differ from repositories’ existing descriptive practices, this guide has been developed for purpose of unifying and aligning born-digital description standards across UC campuses. Along with the Guidelines for Efficient Archival Processing in the University of California Libraries, the UC Guidelines for Born-Digital Archival Description will establish the foundation of archival processing and descriptive practices throughout the UC system and beyond.

## Systems of Record
Stewards of born-digital material rely on metadata. This information is captured at various points in the preservation lifecycle, according to different schemas, by different tools, and is used for distinct purposes. Preserving born-digital material in the long-term requires collection managers to coordinate the strategies and systems used to collect, store, and disseminate this information over time.  

These guidelines do not attempt to outline all necessary preservation actions or metadata requirements for managing born-digital archival material. Rather, they focus exclusively on describing born-digital collections material in the context of a finding aid so that archival collections can be discovered and used.  

Finding aids exist to help researchers determine whether information within a collection is relevant to their research and readily accessible. They are not and should not be used as the system of record for all the descriptive and technical metadata generated during processing. In many cases, metadata will be generated during processing that is ultimately important in the context of a collection management, but inessential and perhaps inappropriate within the context of the finding aid. An example of this would be a complete record of the preservation events that occur during processing. This information is clearly important, but including it in a finding aid in its entirety--particularly for collections with larger digital components--would quickly render the finding aid top-heavy and jargon-filled. However, some of this information can provide clarity and context to researchers as they first encounter born-digital material in collections. It is up to the archivist to make a determination about where to draw the line between providing an appropriate level of detail and too much information. 

With that in mind, one solution to this dilemma is to document this information elsewhere and provide readers with a link that would allow them to access this information if they wish. For instance, institutions should consider using standardized language in the Processing Information section that includes a link to their institutional standards and policies for processing born-digital collection materials rather than trying to outline them in the finding aid. (See, for example, the Bentley Historical Library’s Digital Processing Note).**[4]** This increases transparency, makes the process of creating finding aids more efficient, and helps researchers better understand how a collection was processed.  

Other instances in which archivists should consider linking out to institutional policy or practice include, but are not limited to:
* File formats accessible onsite
* Processing practices or standards
* Digital archives or digital preservation policies
* Policies pertaining to personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI)

## Level of Description
For wholly unprocessed collections (whether hybrid or purely born-digital) the authors recommend following the UC Guidelines for Efficient Archival Processing (especially section 4.G) to determine an appropriate level of description.**[5]** 

However, many special collections departments continue to grapple with a large backlog of unprocessed born-digital materials which have been separated from processed paper-based materials of the same provenance. Working through this backlog to reunite born-digital content with parent collections will be an ongoing process over a number of years, so specific guidelines addressing these types of materials are also needed.

 For unprocessed born-digital materials which are part of a partially-processed hybrid collection, it is helpful to review the existing level(s) of description for paper-based material. Depending on the collection’s complexity and size, can born-digital content be easily integrated into this finding aid structure? If paper-based material is fairly homogenous and is sufficiently described at the series level, consider if the same level of description can be helpfully applied to born-digital material. Refer to standards for multilevel description found in ISAD(G),**[6]** DACS, and the Guidelines for Efficient Archival Processing in the University of California Libraries, section 4.G. 

For example, if a collection includes a series of regular annual reports in both paper and electronic form, it may be more efficient to describe this content together at the series level rather than listing each report separately. If file lists or directory lists are useful and can be easily generated and attached to the finding aid, then they should be included as attachments. For the purpose of these descriptive guidelines however, the authors differentiate between a file list and archival description. A key function of archival description is intellectual control. This should be carried out at whatever level is warranted by a given collection. The level of description should not necessarily be tied to the question of whether or not a file list can be generated with ease. See the Container List & Inventory section of this document for more information.

[1] For example, DACS 4.3, “Technical Access”, outlines metadata creation practices which assume that patrons would be required to access digital materials using the original hardware which created that material, but the field of digital archives has gone in an almost entirely different direction than this. Additionally, DACS 7.1.8, “Processing Information Note” (within “Notes” element), contains rules applying most closely to the EAD <processinfo> element. This is arguably the most important descriptive element for born-digital material, however DACS does not mention digital material at all in this section.
